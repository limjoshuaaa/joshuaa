                The Stop Poverty statement is Give to care and Care to give (Geven om elkaar). Our mission is to provide the basic needs of those, who can not provide for themselves (or are not provided for by other means) and help them to become self-reliant and lead a decent life in dignity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The Stop Poverty projects are focused on the basic needs of people, like Education and Health. At the same time our projects always aim at sustainability by realizing local money generating initiatives like agriculture projects, micro finances and vocational training programs. Thus contributing in Uganda and India to strong communities. The goal is that these communities can continue to provide for their own population and children in health and education.

            <p class="text-justify">
                THE VISION of Stop Poverty is to contribute to the eradication of poverty in this world. This is a REALISTIC goal. WE have GOOD NEWS.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The decline of poverty worldwide is amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Hundred years ago, about 90% of the world population was still living under the poverty line, today it is less than 10%. In Spite of the growth of the world population from about 1 billion to over 7 billion today, poverty is declining.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Still hundreds of millions of people in Africa and India live in extreme poverty, as defined by the United Nations of US $ 1,90 per day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                By our integral way of working in Work and Income, Education and Health, Stop Poverty accomplishes sustainable community projects.
                With a clear beginning (sponsorship) and a clear ending (financially self-sustainable)
