                        1. Quality education
                        Access to quality education which provides children with the knowledge and life skills they need to realize their full potential. It’s also essential to creating change in a child’s life. Plan International helps by training teachers, building new schools and breaking down barriers that prevent many children – and girls in particular – from attending school and staying in school.

                        2. Access to Healthcare

                        Water and sanitation are also essential for every child’s survival. Each year, Plan International helps communities build school latrines, community water points and helps to establish organizations to ensure the continued management and maintenance of water points.

                        5. Child participation
                        Child participation: means that children are at the center of everything we do.
